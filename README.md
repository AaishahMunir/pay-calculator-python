# ðŸ’¼ Pay Calculator (Python)

This is a beginner-level Python script that:
- Takes input for number of hours worked and hourly rate
- Calculates the total pay
- Prints the result

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
- Prompts the user for `hours` and `rate`
- Converts both to `float`
- Multiplies them to get `pay`
- Displays the result using `print()`
